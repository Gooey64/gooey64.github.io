        <p>The Gong Cha in Davis Square has been one of my favourite places
            since I came to Tufts. I love the drinks there, the shop has a cozy
            atmosphere, and they occasionally have kpop cupsleeve events that I
            like to go to!

            <p>Something people don't expect about me is that even though I'm a
                Computer Science major and play a lot of video games, I'm really
                terrible at most of them.
